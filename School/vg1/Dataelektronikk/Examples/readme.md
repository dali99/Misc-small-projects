Made this to teach classmate who didn't know much about arduino different concepts.

#[Seven segments](https://github.com/dali99/Misc-small-projects/blob/master/School/vg1/Dataelektronikk/Examples/Seven%20segments.ino)
Displays different numbers to a seven segmented display, aaamazing, right? Is an example of using switches, #defines, for loops and making functions

#[Multiplexer](https://github.com/dali99/Misc-small-projects/blob/master/School/vg1/Dataelektronikk/Examples/Multiplexer.ino)
Super silly, absolutely no reason to do this ever. But it did show him the concept of multiplexing.

And I guess it saves on power consumtion!
